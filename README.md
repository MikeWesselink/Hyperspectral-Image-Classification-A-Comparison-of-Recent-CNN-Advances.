# Hyperspectral-Image-Classification-A-Comparison-of-Recent-CNN-Advances.

This project contains files from my Minnesota State University - Mankato CIS 631 Machine Learning class final project.  My professor was Dr. Suboh Alkhushayni.

The project is as the title indicates, Hyperspectral Image Classification:  A Comparison of Recent CNN Advances.

In addition to the data files for the Indian Pines (IP) data set I was able to download here, you will need Pavia University (PU), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and Salinas Scene (Salinas).  These can be download at: https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes#Indian_Pines

In order to run the programs in this repository, you will need both the large .mat files and the small ground-truth files which are in the .mat format as well.

I apologize for the fact I could not maintain the paths for the various data sets as I moved them to this repository.  You will need to adjust the code accordingly for the local directory where you wish to run the code.
